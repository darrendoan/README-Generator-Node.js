# Node.js README Generator

## Description
This is a readme generator made using node.js and Javascript. This is the challenge for module 9 from the USYD Coding Bootcamp, which students are required to make a readme generator using Javascript and node.js. This also happens to be the first challenge that requires a video demonstration of the completed challenge. This challenge solves the need to create a README file completely from scratch, as it provides prompts for the user to fill in. After said prompts are filled in, the file is created and voila you have a simple readme file that you can use.

## Installation
1. download the code file or fork/clone the repository
2. open the file
3. right click on index.js and open the intergrated terminal
4. type node index.js 
5. fill out prompts

## Credits
I'd like to thank my intructors Prateek and Tom for providing guidance during and after class with any questions I had on the challenge
